            <p>This is a list of systems we interface with a short description of each.</p>
            <p>
					<strong>Pyxis</strong><br>
					The BD Pyxis MedStation automated medication dispensing system supports decentralized medication management with various features for safety and efficiency. The system helps accurately dispense medication, while supporting pharmacy workflows.
					<br><br>	
					<strong>Allscripts</strong><br>
					Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. is a publicly traded American company that provides physician practices, hospitals, and other healthcare providers with practice management and electronic health record technology.
					<br><br>	
					
					<strong>STAR</strong><br>
					The McKesson STAR system allows hospitals to determine patient coverage and their ability to pay for services. The technology also gives healthcare organizations the resources to better understand the true costs of the services they are providing. It enables hospitals and other care providers to access information that they need when negotiating contracts with vendors.  The STAR system allows physicians and hospital staff to accurately authorize services, validate coverage for payment, assess payment risk, and even schedule resources before a patient arrives.  Think of McKesson STAR as one single, smooth process from pre-registration through final payment. 
					<br><br>	
					
					<strong>PACS</strong><br>
					A picture archiving and communication system (PACS).  That is, a medical imaging technology which provides economical storage and convenient access to images from multiple source machine types.  Electronic images and reports are transmitted digitally via PACS; this eliminates the need to manually file, retrieve, or transport film jackets, the folders used to store and protect X-ray film. The universal format for PACS image storage and transfer is DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). Non-image data, such as scanned documents, may be incorporated using consumer industry standard formats like PDF, once encapsulated in DICOM. A PACS consists of four major components: The imaging modalities such as X-ray plain film (PF), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a secured network for the transmission of patient information, workstations for interpreting and reviewing images, and archives for the storage and retrieval of images and reports.
					<br><br>	
					
					
					<strong>Teletracking</strong><br>
					Provides real-time capacity management platform to hospital administrators, clinicians and managers with real-time visibility and accountability to better manage all areas impacted by patient demand, including patient rooms and beds, operating rooms and procedural areas, workforce management and mobile equipment asset management.
					<br><br>	
					
					<strong>Epiphany</strong><br>
					Cardio Server ECG Management System
					<br><br>	
					
					<strong>MMODAL</strong><br>
					Cloud-based clinical documentation solutions that connect workflows for efficient and accurate medical speech recognition, medical transcription, CDI, and coding.
